This is the program which converts the phrases into acronyms.I do this by splitting and indexing to get the first word and then combine it. Letâ€™s see how to create an acronym using Python
  
    First of all, to make a acronym we need a phrase or sentence. So first we take a input string from user.
    After that, we split this string by using split() function. This function spli the string into different words.
    Then, we create a empty string variable in we store the acronyms of words.
    Now, we take a for loop to iterate the splitted words of phrase or sentence. By iterating words we can take first letter of every word by indexing then we can concatenate the 
    first letter and store in the acronym variable
    We can print acronym and get or create the acronym of any phrase or sentence.
